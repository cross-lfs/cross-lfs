  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to complete the temporary tools to create
  a minimal system that will be used to boot the target machine and to build
  the final system packages.</para>

  <para>There are a few additional packages that will need to be
installed to allow you to boot the minimal system. Most of these
packages will be installed onto the root or in /usr on the LFS
partition ($LFS/bin, $LFS/usr/lib, etc...), rather than /tools.
However, since you are still installing these packages from the host
system, these packages will need to be installed using the "DESTDIR"
option with make.</para>

<para>More detailed info about DESTDIR needed here...</para>

<para>Also, since you will need to create directories and install
packages in them in $LFS (and of course don't want to use root to do
this, to avoid damage to the host system), outside of /tools and
/cross-tools, you will need to temporarily change the ownership of
$LFS to the <systemitem class="username">lfs</systemitem> user. Run
the following command as <systemitem
class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>chown lfs $LFS</userinput></screen>
