  <sect2>
    <title>Part III - Make the Cross-Compile Tools</title>

    <para>Part III shows you how to make a set of Cross-Compiler
          tools. These tools can run on your host system but allow you to
          build packages that will run on your target system.</para>

  </sect2>

    <title>Part IV - Building the Basic Tools</title>

    <para>Part IV explains how to build a tool chain designed
          to operate on your target system. These are the tools
          that will allow you to build a working system on your

    <title>Part V - Building the CLFS System</title>

    <para>Part V guides the reader through the building of the CLFS
    system&mdash;compiling and installing all the packages one by one,
    setting up the boot scripts, and installing the kernel. The resulting
    Linux system is the foundation on which other software can be built to
    expand the system as desired. At the end of this book, there is an
    easy to use reference listing all of the programs, libraries, and
    important files that have been installed.</para>

    <para>The Appendices contain various information that doesn't really fit
    anywhere else in the book. Appendix A contains definitions of acronyms and
    terms used in the book, Appendix B has Acknowledgments of people who
    have helped work on the CLFS project and website, and Appendices C
    and D have information about package dependencies and the the
    build order. Some architectures may have additional appendices for
    arch-specific issues.</para>
