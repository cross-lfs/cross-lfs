  <title>Prerequisites</title>

  <para>Building a CLFS system is not a simple task. It requires a certain
  level of existing knowledge of Unix system administration in order to
  resolve problems, and correctly execute the commands listed. In particular,
  as an absolute minimum, the reader should already have the ability to use
  the command line (shell) to copy or move files and directories, list
  directory and file contents, and change the current directory. It is also
  expected that the reader has a reasonable knowledge of using and installing
  Linux software. A basic knowledge of the architectures being used in
  the Cross LFS process and the host operating systems in use is also
  required.</para>

  <para>Because the CLFS book assumes <emphasis>at least</emphasis> this basic
  level of skill, the various CLFS support forums are unlikely to be able to
  provide you with much assistance in these areas. Your questions regarding
  such basic knowledge will likely go unanswered, or you will be referred to
  the CLFS essential pre-reading list.</para>

  <para>Before building a CLFS system, we recommend reading the following
  HOWTOs:</para>
