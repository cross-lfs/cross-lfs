  <title>About ${CLFS}</title>

  <para>Throughout this book, the environment variable <envar>CLFS</envar> will
  be used several times. It is paramount that this variable is always defined.
  It should be set to the mount point chosen for the CLFS partition.
  For the purposes of this book, it is assumed that the file system
  will be mounted under <filename class="directory">/mnt/clfs</filename>,
  but the directory choice is up to you. Decide on a directory location and set
  the variable with the following command:</para>

<screen><userinput>export CLFS=<replaceable>[/mnt/clfs]</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Having this variable set is beneficial in that commands such as
  <command>install -dv ${CLFS}/tools</command> can be typed literally. The shell
  will automatically replace <quote>${CLFS}</quote> with
  <quote>/mnt/clfs</quote> (or whatever the variable was set to) when it
  processes the command line.</para>

  <para>Do not forget to check that <envar>${CLFS}</envar> is set whenever
  you leave and reenter the current working environment (as when doing a
  <quote>su</quote> to <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> or
  another user). Check that the <envar>CLFS</envar> variable is set up
  properly with:</para>

<screen><userinput>echo ${CLFS}</userinput></screen>

  <para>Make sure the output shows the path to the CLFS partition's mount
  point, which is <filename class="directory">/mnt/clfs</filename> if the
  provided example was followed. If the output is incorrect, use the command
  given earlier on this page to set <envar>${CLFS}</envar> to the correct
  directory name.</para>
