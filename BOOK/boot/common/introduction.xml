  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to complete the build of temporary tools to
  create a minimal system that will be used to boot the target machine and to
  build the final system packages.</para>

  <para>There are a few additional packages that will need to be
  installed to allow you to boot the minimal system. They will be installed
  into <filename class="directory">/tools</filename>, but a few additional
  files and symlinks will be needed on the CLFS partition to be able to boot
  and log in. This will require the
  <systemitem class="username">clfs</systemitem> user to have write access to
  the rest of the CLFS partition, so you will need to temporarily change the
  ownership of ${CLFS} to the <systemitem class="username">clfs</systemitem> user.
  Run the following command as <systemitem
  class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>chown -v clfs ${CLFS}</userinput></screen>
