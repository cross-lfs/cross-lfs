  <title>How to View the Book</title>

  <para>Most likely, you have been using a web browser or PDF viewer to read
  the CLFS book so far. However, the temporary system in
  <filename class="directory">/tools</filename> does not have
  any of these, so you will need to find a way to continue following the book
  after booting into the temporary build environment. Possible solutions
  include:</para>

  <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
      <para>Simply have the book open on another computer, or even read a
      printed copy, though one downside to this is that you cannot
      copy-and-paste commands.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Convert the CLFS book into plain text, thus allowing it to be
      viewed with <command>more</command> or <command>view</command>, by using
      a command such as the following:</para>

<screen><userinput>lynx -dump /path/to/clfs/book.html &gt; ${CLFS}/root/CLFS-book.txt</userinput></screen>

    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Cross-compile and install additional programs before booting,
      such as Lynx or Links to view the book, or Dropbear to allow remote
      login. See the CLFS Hints website at <ulink url="&hints-root;"/> for more
      suggestions by other users.</para>
