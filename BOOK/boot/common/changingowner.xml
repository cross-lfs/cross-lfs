  <title>Changing Ownership</title>

  <para os="a">Currently, the <filename class="directory">${CLFS}</filename>
  directory and all of its subdirectories  are owned by the user
  <systemitem class="username">clfs</systemitem>, a user that exists only
  on the host system. For security reasons, the ${CLFS} root directory and
  all of it subdirectories should be owned by
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>. Change the ownership
  for ${CLFS} and its subdirectories by running this command:</para>

<screen os="b"><userinput>chown -Rv root:root ${CLFS}</userinput></screen>
