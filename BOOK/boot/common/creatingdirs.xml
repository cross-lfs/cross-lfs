  <title>Creating Directories</title>

  <para os="a">It is time to create some structure in the CLFS file system. Create a
  standard directory tree by issuing the following commands:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -pv ${LFS}/{bin,boot,dev,etc/opt,home,lib,mnt,opt}
mkdir -pv ${LFS}/{proc,media/{floppy,cdrom},sbin,srv,sys,var}
install -dv -m 0750 ${LFS}/root
install -dv -m 1777 ${LFS}{/var,}/tmp
mkdir -pv ${LFS}/usr/{,local/}{bin,include,lib,sbin,src}
mkdir -pv ${LFS}/usr/{,local/}share/{doc,info,locale,man}
mkdir -v  ${LFS}/usr/{,local/}share/{misc,terminfo,zoneinfo}
mkdir -pv ${LFS}/usr/{,local/}share/man/man{1..8}
for dir in ${LFS}/usr{,/local}; do
  ln -sv share/{man,doc,info} $dir
done
mkdir -v ${LFS}/var/{lock,log,mail,run,spool}
mkdir -pv ${LFS}/var/{opt,cache,lib/{misc,locate},local}</userinput></screen>

  <para os="b">Directories are, by default, created with permission mode 755,
  but this is not desirable for all directories. In the commands above,
  two changes are made&mdash;one to the home directory of user
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, and another to the
  directories for temporary files.</para>

  <para os="c">The first mode change ensures that not just anybody can enter
  the <filename class="directory">${LFS}/root</filename> directory&mdash;the
  same as a normal user would do with his or her home directory. The
  second mode change makes sure that any user can write to the
  <filename class="directory">${LFS}/tmp</filename> and
  <filename class="directory">${LFS}/var/tmp</filename> directories, but
  cannot remove another user's files from them. The latter is prohibited
  by the so-called <quote>sticky bit,</quote> the highest bit (1) in the
  1777 bit mask.</para>

  <sect2 os="d">
    <title>FHS Compliance Note</title>

    <para>The directory tree is based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
    (FHS) (available at <ulink url="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/"/>). In
    addition to the tree created above, this standard stipulates the
    existence of <filename class="directory">/usr/local/games</filename>
    and <filename class="directory">/usr/share/games</filename>. The FHS
    is not precise as to the structure of the <filename
    class="directory">/usr/local/share</filename> subdirectory, so we
    create only the directories that are needed. However, feel free to
    create these directories if you prefer to conform more strictly to
    the FHS.</para>
