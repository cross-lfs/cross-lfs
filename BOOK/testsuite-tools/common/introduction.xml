  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter builds the tools needed by some packages to run the tests
  that they have. I.e., <command>make check</command>. Tcl, Expect,
  and DejaGNU are needed for the GCC, Binutils, and Findutils test suites.
  Installing three packages for testing purposes may seem excessive, but it is
  very reassuring, if not essential, to know that the most important tools are
  working properly.</para>
