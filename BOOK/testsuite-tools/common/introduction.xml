  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter builds the tools needed to run the tests
  that the packages have. I.e., <command>make check</command>. Tcl, Expect,
  DejaGNU and File are needed for the GCC and Binutils testsuites, and Tree
  is used by the Udev testsuite. Installing five packages for testing purposes
  may seem excessive, but it is very reassuring, if not essential, to know
  that the most important tools are working properly.</para>
