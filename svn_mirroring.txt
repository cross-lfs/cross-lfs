The Following modules will need to be added to your apache, you
will need to make sure your apache was compiled with --enable-proxy.
If it has not, you will need to recompile it.

LoadModule proxy_module lib/apache/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module lib/apache/mod_proxy_http.so

Along with the svn ones.

LoadModule dav_svn_module     lib/apache/mod_dav_svn.so

Follow the BLFS instructions to install rsync daemon

You will need to setup rsyncd to allow files to be transferred in
after a commit.

Here is a our /etc/rsyncd.conf. You will need to change the uid = apache to
what ever user is running apache.

---start
motd file = /home/rsync/welcome.msg
use chroot = yes

uid = rsync
gid = rsync

[clfs]
	path = /srv/svn/cross-lfs
	comment = CLFS svn rsync module
	read only = no
	list = yes
	uid = apache
	hosts allow = 209.172.44.8
	secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets
---end

Here is an the /etc/rsyncd.secrets

---start
clfs:clfs
---end

After you get that setup you will need to run the following commands
to make your repo active. You will need to change the apache:root to
whatever user is running apache.

install -d /srv/svn
svnadmin create cross-lfs
chown apache:root cross-lfs -R

rsync -avz cross-lfs.org::clfs /srv/svn/cross-lfs/db
