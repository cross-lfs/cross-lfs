  <para>The software used to create a CLFS system is constantly being
  updated and enhanced. Security warnings and bug fixes may become
  available after the CLFS book has been released. Some host systems may
  also have problems building CLFS. To check whether the package versions
  or instructions in this release of CLFS need any modifications to
  accommodate security vulnerabilities, other bug fixes, or host-specific
  issues, please visit <ulink url="&errata;"/> before proceeding with your
  build. You should note any changes shown and apply them to the relevant
  section of the book as you progress with building the CLFS system.</para>
